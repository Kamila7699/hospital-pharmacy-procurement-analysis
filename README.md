This project presents an analysis of hospital pharmacy procurement data for the years 2022–2024. The objective of the analysis was to assess the share of purchases made outside formal supplier contracts and to identify suppliers generating off-contract costs. The dataset used in the project is simulated and includes invoice-level data such as invoice number, supplier, issue date, gross value, document type, warehouse, and contract information.
Data preparation included text standardization using TRIM, conversion of text-formatted numerical values into numeric format, validation of sign consistency between invoices and corrections, duplicate checks, and classification of transactions into “contract” and “off-contract” categories. The cleaned dataset was then used to build pivot tables and a dashboard presenting key performance indicators and trends over time.
The analysis showed that 20.8% of the total procurement value in the analyzed period was executed outside formal contracts. The share of off-contract purchases remained relatively stable over time, indicating a consistent structure of procurement behavior across the three years. Although the distribution of off-contract purchases among suppliers is relatively diversified, MedicaPharm generated the highest off-contract value, which may indicate an area for further investigation.
The results suggest that off-contract purchasing has a systemic rather than incidental character. From a business perspective, this may indicate the need to review the scope of existing contracts or to analyze operational drivers behind non-contracted purchases. The project was completed using Microsoft Excel with pivot tables, data validation logic, and a structured dashboard layout.
